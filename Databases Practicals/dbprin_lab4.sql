-- Correct Approach ^

-- - Using left join ensures all departments are preserved and still display even if there are no matches under projects or employees.
-- - Missing data can just be returned as NULL, or can use COALESCE to display N/A e.t.c
-- - Using RIGHT JOIN in Option C means not starting from the main table of departments, it will likely work most of the time but isn't the best option for satisfying the requirements.

-- If you swapped LEFT and RIGHT joins, it would still return the same result, but it could make the query less readable and risk including unrelated rows if join directions aren’t applied carefully.
